            <p>My name is Bailey Christopher Terry. Now I know what you're thinking, "You can't trust someone with three first names", but I happen 
                to be an exception to that rule. My name comes from my strong Irish and British heritage as well as my mother's wish to have a 
                creative first name for her children. When I was a child I used to hate my first name (I wanted my name to be Jake), couldn't spell
                my middle name, and thought my last name was boring. Now that I am older I love my name as a whole and I have become a lot more 
                interested in my family heritage.

            <p>I consider myself to be a very nerdy person. Firstly I am a self-proclaimed shark expert and will be retiring by the ocean so I can
                study and admire sharks in my late life. Not only am I persuing software engineering as a career but I absolutely love Star Wars
                - I know way too much lore about the cinematic universe - and I grew up learning all the spells in Harry Potters world (it's 
                LeviOOsa not Leviosaaa). I also am a big video gamer; I love RPG games, survival games, puzzle games, and adventure games. My top 
                three favorite video games are:

                    <li>
                        Overwatch
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Skyrim

            <p>I like to stay active in my free time when I'm not gaming. I have my dog, Finn, who I take on walks; I like to go to parks and hike
                around with my girlfiend; I love to go swimming whenever I have the opportunity; lastly, I am the first to volunteer whenever 
                friends or family members need help around the yard or moving things around the house just to get some sun or movement.
