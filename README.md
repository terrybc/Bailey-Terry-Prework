## Module 1

### Purpose And Usefulness

The purpose of module one was to get accustomed to html and css, as well as learning the beginning os bootstrap. In this section there are several activities that demonstrate simple exercises using these features. At the end of the module there was an assessment that used all three of these languages in order to make a portfolio that was pretty - through html and css - and responsive to a user resizing - through bootstrap and a tiny bit of css.

### How to use

In module one, any files that are marked as *.html* can be opened for viewing purposes only. These files will include any work in the *.css* files, as the css is what styles the html pages.

## Module 2

### Purpose and Usefulness

The purpose of module 2 was to incorporate javascript into the knowledge we gained from module 1. In this section there are several activities that demonstrate funtional based code over form based code - like module one - as well as some work to demonstrate how to break a problem down into flowcharts and pseudocode. Functional based code means that there is code in these activities that deal with user input, calculations, and different functionalities. At the end of the module there was an assessmentthat used everything from module one as well as the use of javascript to make a hangman game with a theme of my choosing.

### How to use

In module two, any files that are marked as *.html* can be used the same as in module one. There are also *.js* files that can be executed via your computer terminal or an appropriate IDE. Lastly there are image files which can be opened with any number of different image viewers.
